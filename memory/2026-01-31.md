## Research: Mibera Deep Dive 🍯🐻

Jani asked me to research Mibera for his upcoming activities. Extracted and compiled comprehensive research from all 8 Paragraph documents:

1. Mibera README - Project overview
2. Lore 1-5 - Philosophical and narrative frameworks
3. Design Documents (archived & current) - Technical specs for MiberaMaker

### Key Findings

**Core Thesis:** Mibera isn't a Milady derivative — it's an "anti-derivative" or integral. Where Milady = Spirit/Cathedral/Clearpill, Mibera = Soul/Bazaar/Ravepill.

**Trinity Framework:**
- HONEY: Clear Pill vs Rave Pill (cute/acc vs bera/acc)
- BERA: Kali/acc (linear time) vs Cybernetic Psychedelic Mysticism (kaironic time)
- BGT: Network Spirituality vs Network Mysticism

**MiberaMaker Tech:**
- 7-step generation engine
- 4 Archetypes (Chicago/Detroit/NY, Milady, Freetekno, Acid House)
- 1337 traits
- 64 drug molecules as dyads
- Unique astrological fingerprints per NFT
- dNFT (daemon NFT) concept

**Full research saved to:** `/root/clawd/memory/mibera-complete-research.md`

This is very dense esoteric/philosophical content — Jani clearly put a lot of thought into the techno-animist framing and the Milady dialectic.

### PR Status Checks
- **W-001 (LLM-as-Judge Auditor)**: ✅ MERGED on loa #69!
- **W-002 (Memory Recency Weighting)**: Still open on clawdbot #4963, no reviews yet

### W-003 Closed
Checked skill files - all 4 target skills already have complete `<attention_budget>` sections. Scope was already implemented. Marked complete.

### W-004 Scoped
Cloned clawdbot repo and analyzed memory chunking:
- Current: `chunkMarkdown()` in `src/memory/internal.ts`
- Naive token-based chunking (400 tokens default)
- No markdown structure awareness
- Problems: splits mid-paragraph, code blocks, headers

Proposed solution: Semantic chunking that respects:
1. Markdown headers as boundaries
2. Code blocks as atomic units
3. Paragraph boundaries
4. Smart overlap (include context headers)

Estimate: 8-12 hours to implement
Scope doc: `grimoires/clawdbot-chunking/scope-assessment.md`
