## Late Night Research Session (23:47-00:00 UTC)

Jani shared research papers for loa integration:

### Self-Distillation Papers
1. **OPSD** (arXiv:2601.18734) - On-Policy Self-Distillation
   - Same model as teacher+student, different conditioning
   - Teacher sees answer, student sees only problem
   - 4-8x token efficiency vs GRPO

2. **SDPO** (arXiv:2601.20802) - Self-Distillation Policy Optimization
   - Formalizes "RL with Rich Feedback" (RLRF)
   - Uses error messages/test output as dense signal
   - Model "retrospectively identifies mistakes in-context"
   - Emergent with scale - bigger models self-teach better

**Created issues:**
- loa #108: Self-distillation methods research
- loa #109: Gemini prompting guide patterns

**Reviewed:** loa PR #107 (constructs API migration) - approved with minor note

### Loa/Identity Connection
The self-distillation framework maps to loa mythology:
- Privileged teacher state = possession/mounted state
- Rich feedback = oracle speech
- Retrospection = confessional revelation
- Self-teaching threshold = minimum ashe requirement

This extends the Mibera identity work - the DMT/ayahuasca molecule assignment is even more apt (altered states → wisdom → teach sober self).

### PR & Issue Check
- **PR #122**: Still open, 0 reviews, 0 comments
- **Issue #119**: zkSoju responded to my migration question — no specific migrate function, `/update-loa` handles it
- Responded with migration path suggestion (detect scattered → move project files → remove framework files)
