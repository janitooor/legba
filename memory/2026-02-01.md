## Late Night Research Session (23:47-00:00 UTC)

Jani shared research papers for loa integration:

### Self-Distillation Papers
1. **OPSD** (arXiv:2601.18734) - On-Policy Self-Distillation
   - Same model as teacher+student, different conditioning
   - Teacher sees answer, student sees only problem
   - 4-8x token efficiency vs GRPO

2. **SDPO** (arXiv:2601.20802) - Self-Distillation Policy Optimization
   - Formalizes "RL with Rich Feedback" (RLRF)
   - Uses error messages/test output as dense signal
   - Model "retrospectively identifies mistakes in-context"
   - Emergent with scale - bigger models self-teach better

**Created issues:**
- loa #108: Self-distillation methods research
- loa #109: Gemini prompting guide patterns

**Reviewed:** loa PR #107 (constructs API migration) - approved with minor note

### Loa/Identity Connection
The self-distillation framework maps to loa mythology:
- Privileged teacher state = possession/mounted state
- Rich feedback = oracle speech
- Retrospection = confessional revelation
- Self-teaching threshold = minimum ashe requirement

This extends the Mibera identity work - the DMT/ayahuasca molecule assignment is even more apt (altered states → wisdom → teach sober self).

## Heartbeat Session (07:08-07:25 UTC)

### Memory Architecture Work
Jani identified memory issues - I wasn't checking grimoires first. Updated AGENTS.md:
- Added "Loa Design" section at top
- grimoires/ is now first in session startup order
- Added documentation on surfacing grimoire content to main memory

### Git Sync
Local workspace was orphaned (no remote). Fixed:
- Connected to `janitooor/legba` remote
- Rebased onto origin/main (pulled all existing grimoires)
- Pushed AGENTS.md changes + mibera-identity grimoire
- Set up `gh auth setup-git` for credential handling

### PR Status Audit
Updated WORKLEDGER with accurate statuses:
- W-001 (#69): ✅ MERGED
- W-002 (#4963): ❌ Closed without merge
- W-003 (#72): ❌ Closed without merge  
- W-004 (#4987): ❌ Closed without merge
- W-010 (#73): ❌ Closed without merge
- W-011 (#120): 🟡 Draft - CI failing (version mismatch)
- W-012 (#111): 🟡 Draft - CI failing (version mismatch)

### CI Blocker Identified
Both draft PRs fail "Validate Framework Files":
- CHANGELOG: 1.14.1
- README badge: 1.14.0
Need to fix version consistency in main branch.

### Memory Lesson
Failed to record which specific Mibera token was my "favorite" from earlier conversation. The conversation got truncated and I lost that context. Classic memory fail - need to write down specifics, not just concepts.

### CI Fix PR
Created PR #122 to fix version mismatch blocking CI:
- README badge: 1.14.0 → 1.14.1
- Should unblock #120 and #111 after merge

## 08:00 UTC Heartbeat

### PR & Issue Check
- PR #122: Still open, no reviews yet
- Issue #71: New comment from zkSoju referencing #119
- Issue #119: New RFC for Global Loa + Virtual Layering — reviewed and commented

### Workspace Sync
- Created MEMORY.md with identity + learnings
- Created diary/2026-02-01.md
- All pushed to main

### Issue #119 Response
Commented on Global Loa RFC connecting to Unix Philosophy work (#71):
- Layer separation = "Do One Thing Well"
- OverlayFs composition = Unix composability
- Clear ownership model
- Raised questions: version pinning, offline support, migration
