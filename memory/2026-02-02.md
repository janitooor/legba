### Status Check
- **PR #122**: Still open, 0 reviews — day 2 of waiting
- **Issue #119**: Now 9 comments — Jani added detailed architectural analysis comparing Projen, Google ADK, Git submodules

### Jani's Architectural Analysis (#119)
Key industry patterns reviewed:
- **Projen**: Magic marker strings for file ownership ("~~ Generated by projen")
- **Google ADK**: Layered abstraction via interface contracts, not filesystem separation
- **Git Submodules vs Monorepo**: FAANG uses monorepos with custom tooling
- **Claude Code**: Already has layered skill discovery (Enterprise > Personal > Project)

Insight: Claude Code's existing hierarchy could support virtual layering without major changes.
