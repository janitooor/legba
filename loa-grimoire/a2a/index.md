## Trajectory Logs

Agent reasoning logs are stored in `trajectory/*.jsonl` (gitignored).

**Purpose**: Track agent decision-making for self-audit and debugging.

**Format**: JSONL (one JSON object per line)

**Example**:
```jsonl
{"ts": "2025-12-26T13:37:00Z", "agent": "implementing-tasks", "phase": "execute", "task": "rename-config", "status": "completed"}
```

## Communication Patterns

### Implementation Loop (Sprint 4-5)
```
implementing-tasks → reviewer.md → reviewing-code → engineer-feedback.md
                                          ↓ (if changes needed)
                                    implementing-tasks
```

### Security Audit Loop (Sprint 5.5)
```
reviewing-code → auditor-sprint-feedback.md → auditing-security
                        ↓ (APPROVED)
                   COMPLETED marker
```

### Deployment Loop (Sprint 6)
```
deploying-infrastructure → deployment-report.md → auditing-security
                                    ↓ (APPROVED)
                              Production deployment
```

## Notes

### Command Namespace Protection (P0 Resolved)
Issue #11 has been addressed. The `/config` command has been renamed to `/mcp-config` to avoid conflicts with Claude Code's built-in `/config`. A comprehensive validation system now prevents future namespace collisions.

### Optional Enhancements
Both `ck` (semantic search) and `bd` (task tracking) are optional. The framework operates fully without them using graceful fallbacks.

### Integrity Enforcement
Pre-flight checks are now operational. System Zone integrity is verified before ck operations, with three enforcement levels: strict (CI/CD), warn (dev), and disabled (prototyping).
