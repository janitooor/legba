## [0.8.0] - 2025-12-27

### Why This Release

This release adds **optional semantic code search** via the `ck` tool, enabling dramatically improved code understanding while maintaining full backward compatibility. The enhancement is **completely invisible** to users—your workflow remains unchanged whether or not you have `ck` installed.

### Added

- **Semantic Code Search Integration** (optional)
  - Vector-based search using nomic-v1.5 embeddings via `ck` tool
  - <500ms search latency on repositories up to 1M LOC
  - 80-90% cache hit rate with delta reindexing
  - Automatic fallback to grep when `ck` unavailable

- **Ghost Feature Detection**
  - Identifies documented but unimplemented features
  - Uses Negative Grounding Protocol (2+ diverse queries returning 0 results)
  - Creates Beads issues for discovered liabilities (if `bd` installed)

- **Shadow System Classification**
  - Identifies undocumented code in repositories
  - Classifies as Orphaned, Drifted, or Partial
  - Generates actionable drift reports

- **8 New Protocol Documents** (`.claude/protocols/`)
  - `preflight-integrity.md` - Integrity verification before operations
  - `tool-result-clearing.md` - Attention budget management
  - `trajectory-evaluation.md` - Agent reasoning audit (enhanced)
  - `negative-grounding.md` - Ghost feature detection protocol
  - `search-fallback.md` - Graceful degradation strategy
  - `citations.md` - Word-for-word citation requirements
  - `self-audit-checkpoint.md` - Pre-completion validation
  - `edd-verification.md` - Evaluation-Driven Development protocol

- **6 New Scripts** (`.claude/scripts/`)
  - `search-orchestrator.sh` - Unified search interface
  - `search-api.sh` - Search API functions (semantic_search, hybrid_search, regex_search)
  - `filter-search-results.sh` - Result deduplication and relevance filtering
  - `compact-trajectory.sh` - Trajectory log compression
  - `validate-protocols.sh` - Protocol documentation validation
  - `validate-ck-integration.sh` - CI/CD validation script (42 checks)

- **Test Suite** (127 total tests)
  - 79 unit tests for core scripts
  - 22 integration tests for /ride workflow
  - 26 edge case tests for error handling
  - Performance benchmarking with PRD target validation

- **Documentation**
  - `RELEASE_NOTES_CK_INTEGRATION.md` - Detailed release notes
  - `MIGRATION_GUIDE_CK.md` - Step-by-step migration guide
  - Updated `INSTALLATION.md` with ck installation instructions
  - Updated `README.md` with semantic search mentions

### Changed

- **`/ride` Command**: Enhanced with semantic analysis
  - Ghost Feature detection in drift report
  - Shadow System classification
  - Improved code reality extraction

- **`/setup` Command**: Shows ck installation status
  - Displays version if installed
  - Provides installation instructions if missing

- **`.gitignore`**: New entries
  - `.ck/` - Semantic search index directory
  - `.beads/` - Beads issue tracking
  - `loa-grimoire/a2a/trajectory/` - Agent reasoning logs

### Technical Details

- **Performance Targets Met**
  | Metric | Target | Achieved |
  |--------|--------|----------|
  | Search Speed (1M LOC) | <500ms | ✅ |
  | Cache Hit Rate | 80-90% | ✅ |
  | Grounding Ratio | ≥0.95 | ✅ |
  | User Experience Parity | 100% | ✅ |

- **Invisible Enhancement Pattern**: All commands work identically with or without `ck` installed. No mentions of "semantic search", "ck", or "fallback" in agent output.

### Breaking Changes

**None** - This release is fully backward compatible.

### Installation (Optional)

```bash
# Install ck for semantic search
cargo install ck-search

# Install bd for issue tracking
npm install -g beads-cli

# Both tools are optional - Loa works perfectly without them
```

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-21

### Why This Release

This release delivers a major architectural refactor based on Anthropic's recommendations for Claude Code skills development. The focus is on action-oriented naming, modular architecture, and extracting deterministic logic to reusable scripts—making skills more maintainable and reducing context overhead.

### Added

- **v4 Command Architecture**: Thin routing layer with YAML frontmatter
  - `agent:` and `agent_path:` fields for skill routing
  - `command_type:` for special commands (wizard, survey, git)
  - `pre_flight:` validation checks before execution
  - `context_files:` with prioritized loading and variable substitution

- **3-Level Skills Architecture**: Modular structure for all 8 agents
  - Level 1: `index.yaml` - Metadata and triggers (~100 tokens)
  - Level 2: `SKILL.md` - KERNEL instructions (<500 lines)
  - Level 3: `resources/` - Templates, scripts, references (loaded on-demand)

- **Context-First Discovery**: `/plan-and-analyze` now ingests existing documentation
  - Auto-scans `loa-grimoire/context/` for `.md` files before interviewing
  - Presents understanding with source citations before asking questions
  - Only asks about gaps, ambiguities, and strategic decisions
  - Parallel ingestion for large context (>2000 lines)
  - New script: `.claude/scripts/assess-discovery-context.sh`

- **8 New Helper Scripts** (`.claude/scripts/`)
  | Script | Purpose |
  |--------|---------|
  | `check-feedback-status.sh` | Sprint feedback state detection |
  | `validate-sprint-id.sh` | Sprint ID format validation |
  | `check-prerequisites.sh` | Phase prerequisite checking |
  | `assess-discovery-context.sh` | Context size assessment |
  | `context-check.sh` | Parallel execution thresholds |

  - `analytics.md` - THJ-only tracking, schema definitions
  - `feedback-loops.md` - A2A communication, approval markers

- **Context Directory** (`loa-grimoire/context/`)
  - New location for pre-discovery documentation
  - Template README with suggested file structure
  - Supports nested directories and any `.md` files

### Changed

- **Skill Naming Convention**: All 8 skills renamed from role-based to action-based (gerund form)
  | Old Name | New Name |
  |----------|----------|
  | `prd-architect` | `discovering-requirements` |
  | `architecture-designer` | `designing-architecture` |
  | `sprint-planner` | `planning-sprints` |
  | `sprint-task-implementer` | `implementing-tasks` |
  | `senior-tech-lead-reviewer` | `reviewing-code` |
  | `paranoid-auditor` | `auditing-security` |
  | `devops-crypto-architect` | `deploying-infrastructure` |
  | `devrel-translator` | `translating-for-executives` |

- **Documentation Streamlining**: Reduced CLAUDE.md from ~1700 to ~200 lines
  - Detailed specifications moved to `.claude/protocols/`
  - Single source of truth principle enforced
  - Command tables reference skill files for details

- **discovering-requirements Skill**: Complete rewrite for context-first workflow

  | deploying-infrastructure | <2,000 | 2,000-5,000 | >5,000 |

### Breaking Changes

- **Skill Names Renamed**: All 8 skills have new names (see Changed section)
  - Custom commands referencing old names will need updates
  - Automation scripts using skill names must be migrated
  - Migration script available: `.claude/scripts/migrate-skill-names.sh`

### Migration Guide

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-20

### Why This Release

Claude Code has a tendency to proactively suggest git operations—committing changes, creating PRs, and pushing to remotes—which can be problematic when working in forked repositories. Developers using Loa as a template for their own projects were at risk of accidentally pushing proprietary code to the public upstream repository (`0xHoneyJar/loa`).

This release introduces comprehensive safety rails to prevent these accidents while still enabling intentional contributions back to the framework.

### Added
- **Git Safety Protocol**: Multi-layer protection against accidental pushes to upstream template repository
  - 4-layer template detection system (origin URL, upstream remote, loa remote, GitHub API)
  - Automatic detection during `/setup` with results stored in marker file
  - Warnings before push/PR operations targeting upstream
  - Prevents accidentally leaking project-specific code to the public Loa repository

- **`/contribute` command**: Guided OSS contribution workflow for contributing back to Loa
  - Pre-flight checks (feature branch, clean working tree, upstream remote)
  - Standards checklist (clean commits, no secrets, tests, DCO)
  - Automated secrets scanning with common patterns (API keys, tokens, credentials)
  - DCO sign-off verification with fix guidance
  - Guided PR creation with proper formatting
  - Handles both fork-based and direct repository contributions

- **Template detection in `/setup`**: New Phase 0.5 detects fork/template relationships
  - Runs before user-type selection
  - Displays safety notice when template detected
  - Stores detection metadata in `.loa-setup-complete` marker file

- **`/config` command**: Post-setup MCP server reconfiguration (THJ only)
  - Allows adding/removing MCP integrations after initial setup
  - Shows currently configured servers
  - Updates marker file with new configuration

### Changed
- **Setup marker file schema**: Now includes `template_source` object with detection metadata
  ```json
  {
    "template_source": {
      "detected": true,
      "repo": "0xHoneyJar/loa",
      "detection_method": "origin_url",
      "detected_at": "2025-12-20T10:00:00Z"
    }
  }
  ```
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added Git Safety Protocol documentation and `/contribute` command reference
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Updated with contribution workflow using `/contribute` command
- **Documentation**: Updated setup flow diagrams and command reference tables

### Security
- **Secrets scanning**: `/contribute` scans for common secret patterns before PR creation
  - AWS access keys (AKIA...)
  - GitHub tokens (ghp_...)
  - Slack tokens (xox...)
  - Private keys (-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----)
  - Generic password/secret/api_key patterns
- **DCO enforcement**: Contribution workflow verifies Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off
- **Template isolation**: Prevents accidental code leakage from forked projects to upstream

  - Setup enforcement: `/plan-and-analyze` now requires setup completion
- **`/feedback` command**: Developer experience survey
  - 4-question survey with progress indicators
  - Linear integration: posts to "Loa Feedback" project
  - Analytics attachment: includes usage.json in feedback
  - Pending feedback safety net: saves locally before submission

  - Fetch, preview, and confirm workflow
  - Merge conflict guidance per file type
  - CHANGELOG excerpt display after update
- **Analytics system**: Usage tracking for feedback context
  - `loa-grimoire/analytics/usage.json` for raw metrics
  - `loa-grimoire/analytics/summary.md` for human-readable summary
  - Tracks: phases, sprints, reviews, audits, deployments
  - Non-blocking: failures logged but don't interrupt workflows
  - Opt-in sharing: only sent via `/feedback` command

### Changed
- **Fresh template**: Removed all generated loa-grimoire content (PRD, SDD, sprint plans, A2A files) so new projects start clean
- All phase commands now update analytics on completion
- `/plan-and-analyze` blocks if setup marker is missing
- `/deploy-production` suggests running `/feedback` after deployment
