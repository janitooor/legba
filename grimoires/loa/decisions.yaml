# Decision Lineage Log
# Tracks architectural and design decisions across Loa phases
# Schema: .claude/schemas/decisions.schema.json
#
# Each decision captures:
# - What was decided and why
# - What alternatives were considered
# - Expected consequences (positive/negative)
# - Source grounding (files, quotes)
#
# Decisions are append-only during a cycle.
# Review and prune during /archive-cycle.

# - id: DEC-0001
#   timestamp: "2026-01-31T09:00:00Z"
#   phase: architecture
#   agent: designing-architecture
#   category: technology
#   summary: "Use PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search"
#   context: "PRD requires semantic search over user documents"
#   decision: "PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector extension"
#   rationale: "Mature, familiar to team, avoids separate vector DB"
#   alternatives_considered:
#     - option: "Pinecone (managed vector DB)"
#       rejected_because: "Adds external dependency, cost scales with vectors"
#     - option: "Elasticsearch with dense_vector"
#       rejected_because: "Overkill for our scale, team unfamiliar"
#   consequences:
#     positive:
#       - "Single database for all data"
#       - "Familiar PostgreSQL operations"
#     negative:
#       - "pgvector performance ceiling at ~1M vectors"
#       - "Must manage index tuning ourselves"
