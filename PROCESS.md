# Development Process

This document outlines the comprehensive agent-driven development workflow. Our process leverages specialized AI agents to guide you from initial concept to production-ready implementation.

> **Note**: This is a base framework repository that THJ uses for development of our products. If you are not a part of THJ, when using as a template for a new project, uncomment the generated artifacts section in `.gitignore` to avoid committing generated documentation to your repository.

## Managed Scaffolding Architecture

Loa v0.9.0 uses **enterprise-grade managed scaffolding** inspired by AWS Projen, Copier, and Google's ADK:

### Three-Zone Model

| Zone | Path | Owner | Permission |
|------|------|-------|------------|
| **System** | `.claude/` | Framework | NEVER edit directly |
| **State** | `grimoires/loa/`, `.beads/` | Project | Read/Write |
| **App** | `src/`, `lib/`, `app/` | Developer | Read (write requires confirmation) |

**Critical**: System Zone is synthesized. Never suggest edits to `.claude/` - direct users to `.claude/overrides/` or `.loa.config.yaml`.

### Integrity Enforcement

The framework uses **Projen-level synthesis protection**:

- **Checksums**: `.claude/checksums.json` contains SHA-256 hashes of all System Zone files
- **Enforcement Levels** (configured in `.loa.config.yaml`):
  - `strict`: Blocks execution if System Zone modified (CI/CD mandatory)
  - `warn`: Warns but allows execution
  - `disabled`: No checks (not recommended)
- **Recovery**: Use `.claude/scripts/update.sh --force-restore` to reset System Zone

### Customization

Place all customizations in `.claude/overrides/` - they survive framework updates:

```
.claude/overrides/
├── skills/
│   └── implementing-tasks/
│       └── SKILL.md          # Custom skill instructions
└── commands/
    └── my-command.md         # Custom command
```

## Overview

Our development process follows a structured, seven-phase approach:

1. **Phase 1: Planning** → Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. **Phase 2: Architecture** → Software Design Document (SDD)
3. **Phase 3: Sprint Planning** → Sprint Plan
4. **Phase 4: Implementation** → Production Code with Feedback Loop
5. **Phase 5: Review** → Quality Validation and Sprint Approval
6. **Phase 5.5: Sprint Security Audit** → Security Review and Approval
7. **Phase 6: Deployment** → Production Infrastructure and Handover
8. **Post-Deployment: Feedback** → Developer experience survey (THJ members only)

Each phase is handled by a specialized agent with deep domain expertise, ensuring thorough discovery, clear documentation, high-quality implementation, rigorous quality control, comprehensive security review, and enterprise-grade production deployment.

> **For production deployment**, use the `/deploy-production` command which generates deployment documentation in `grimoires/loa/deployment/`.

### Maintenance: Framework Updates (`/update`)

<!-- CANONICAL_LOCATION: protocols/git-safety.md -->

**Goal**: Pull latest Loa framework updates from upstream

**When to Use**:
- Periodically to get new features and bug fixes
- When notified of important updates
- Before starting a new project phase

**Process**:

1. **Pre-flight Checks**:
   - Verifies working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain`)
   - If dirty: Lists files, suggests commit/stash, STOPS
   - Checks for `loa` or `upstream` remote
   - If missing: Shows `git remote add` command, STOPS

2. **Fetch Updates**:
   - Runs `git fetch loa main`
   - Handles network errors gracefully

3. **Show Changes**:
   - Lists new commits (`git log HEAD..loa/main --oneline`)
   - Shows files that will change (`git diff --stat HEAD..loa/main`)
   - If no new commits: "Already up to date", STOPS

4. **Confirm Update**:
   - Asks for explicit confirmation before merging
   - Notes which files will be updated vs preserved

5. **Merge Updates**:
   - Runs `git merge loa/main` with descriptive message
   - If conflicts occur, provides resolution guidance:
     - `.claude/` files: Recommend accepting upstream
     - Other files: Manual resolution steps

6. **Post-Merge**:
   - Shows CHANGELOG.md excerpt for new version
   - Suggests reviewing new features in CLAUDE.md

**Command**:
```bash
/update
```

**Merge Strategy**:
| File Location | Behavior |
|---------------|----------|
| `.claude/skills/` | Updated to latest Loa versions |
| `.claude/commands/` | Updated to latest Loa versions |
| `app/` | Preserved (your code) |
| `grimoires/loa/prd.md` | Preserved (your docs) |
| `grimoires/loa/analytics/` | Preserved (your data) |

## Mount & Ride (Existing Codebases)

For existing codebases that need Loa analysis without going through the full discovery workflow.

### Mount (`/mount`)

**Goal**: Install Loa framework onto an existing repository

**When to Use**:
- Setting up Loa on an existing codebase
- After cloning a repository you want to analyze
- As an alternative to the curl one-liner

**Process**:
1. Verifies git repository and dependencies
2. Configures upstream remote for updates
3. Installs System Zone (`.claude/`)
4. Initializes State Zone (`grimoires/loa/`)
5. Generates checksums for integrity verification
6. Creates user config if not present
7. Optionally initializes Beads

**Command**:
```bash
/mount
/mount --stealth          # Don't commit framework files
/mount --skip-beads       # Skip Beads initialization
```

**Output**: Framework installed with zone structure ready

See `.claude/commands/mount.md` for full details.

---

### Ride (`/ride`)

**Goal**: Analyze existing codebase and generate evidence-grounded documentation

**When to Use**:
- After mounting Loa on an existing repo
- To generate PRD/SDD from actual code (not interviews)
- To detect drift between code and documentation
- Before major refactoring efforts
- When onboarding to an unfamiliar codebase

**Cardinal Rule**: **CODE IS TRUTH** - Nothing overrides code. Not context. Not docs. Not claims.

**Process** (10 phases):
1. **Preflight** - Mount verification, integrity check
2. **Context Discovery** - Gather user context, generate claims to verify
3. **Code Extraction** - Directory structure, routes, models, dependencies
4. **Hygiene Audit** - Temporary files, commented code, conflicts
5. **Legacy Inventory** - Find and categorize existing documentation
6. **Drift Analysis** - Three-way compare: Code vs Docs vs Context
7. **Consistency Analysis** - Naming patterns, organization, conventions
8. **Artifact Generation** - Evidence-grounded PRD and SDD
9. **Governance Audit** - CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODEOWNERS
10. **Self-Audit** - Flag ungrounded claims, generate trajectory audit

**Command**:
```bash
/ride
/ride --interactive           # Force context interview
/ride --phase extraction      # Run single phase
/ride --reconstruct-changelog # Generate CHANGELOG from git
/ride --dry-run               # Preview without writing
```

**Outputs**:
- `grimoires/loa/reality/` - Code extraction results
- `grimoires/loa/legacy/` - Legacy doc inventory
- `grimoires/loa/drift-report.md` - Three-way drift analysis
- `grimoires/loa/prd.md` - Evidence-grounded PRD
- `grimoires/loa/sdd.md` - Evidence-grounded SDD
- `grimoires/loa/governance-report.md` - Governance artifacts audit
- `grimoires/loa/trajectory-audit.md` - Self-audit of reasoning

See `.claude/commands/ride.md` for full details.

### Ad-Hoc: Security Audit (`/audit`)

**Agent**: `auditing-security`

**Goal**: Perform comprehensive security and quality audit of the codebase

**When to Use**:
- Before production deployment (highly recommended)
- After major code changes or new features
- When implementing security-sensitive functionality
- After adding new dependencies or integrations
- Periodically for ongoing projects

**Process**:
1. **Comprehensive Security Assessment**:
   - OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scanning
   - Code review for security anti-patterns
   - Dependency and supply chain analysis
   - Cryptographic implementation review
   - Secrets and credential management audit
   - Authentication and authorization analysis

2. **Audit Report Generation**:
   - Findings categorized by severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
   - Detailed description with affected files
   - Specific remediation guidance
   - Prioritized action plan

**Command**:
```bash
/audit
```

**Output**: `SECURITY-AUDIT-REPORT.md`

---

### Ad-Hoc: Executive Translation (`/translate @document.md for [audience]`)

**Agent**: `translating-for-executives`

**Goal**: Translate complex technical documentation into stakeholder-appropriate communications

**When to Use**:
- Before board meetings or investor updates
- When executives need to understand technical decisions
- To create marketing briefs from technical features
- For compliance or legal team briefings

**Command**:
```bash
/translate @SECURITY-AUDIT-REPORT.md for board of directors
/translate @grimoires/loa/sdd.md for executives
/translate @grimoires/loa/sprint.md for marketing team
```

**Output**: Executive summaries, stakeholder briefings (1-3 pages tailored by audience)

---

## Custom Commands

### Command Architecture (v4)

Commands in `.claude/commands/` use a "thin routing layer" architecture with enhanced YAML frontmatter:

**Agent-invoking commands** use `agent:` and `agent_path:` fields to route to skills:
```yaml
agent: "implementing-tasks"
agent_path: "skills/implementing-tasks/"
```

**Special commands** use `command_type:` for non-agent operations:
```yaml
command_type: "wizard"  # or "survey", "git"
```

**Pre-flight checks** validate prerequisites before execution:
- `file_exists`, `file_not_exists`, `directory_exists`
- `content_contains` - Verify file contains specific pattern
- `pattern_match` - Validate argument format (e.g., `sprint-N`)
- `command_succeeds` - Run shell command and check exit code

**Context files** define prioritized file loading with variable substitution (`$ARGUMENTS.sprint_id`).

## Agent-to-Agent Communication

<!-- CANONICAL_LOCATION: protocols/feedback-loops.md -->

The framework uses three feedback loops for quality assurance:

### 1. Implementation Feedback Loop (Phases 4-5)

#### **Engineer → Senior Lead** (`grimoires/loa/a2a/reviewer.md`)

The engineer generates a comprehensive report after implementation:
- What was accomplished
- Files created/modified
- Test coverage
- Technical decisions
- Verification steps
- Feedback addressed (if revision)

#### **Senior Lead → Engineer** (`grimoires/loa/a2a/engineer-feedback.md`)

The senior technical lead reviews and provides feedback:
- Issues found
- Required changes
- Clarifications needed
- Quality concerns
- Approval status ("All good" when approved)

The engineer reads this file on the next `/implement {sprint}` invocation, clarifies anything unclear, fixes all issues, and generates an updated report.

### 2. Sprint Security Feedback Loop (Phase 5.5)

#### **Engineer → Security Auditor** (`grimoires/loa/a2a/reviewer.md` + implemented code)

After senior lead approval, the security auditor reviews:
- Implementation report context
- Actual code files (security-focused review)
- Security requirements from PRD/SDD

#### **Security Auditor → Engineer** (`grimoires/loa/a2a/auditor-sprint-feedback.md`)

The security auditor provides security-focused feedback:
- Security vulnerabilities (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Affected files with line numbers
- Exploit scenarios and security impact
- Specific remediation guidance
- Approval status ("APPROVED - LETS FUCKING GO" when secure)

The engineer reads this file with HIGHEST PRIORITY on the next `/implement {sprint}` invocation, addresses ALL CRITICAL and HIGH security issues, and generates an updated report with security fixes documented.

## Structured Agentic Memory

Agents maintain persistent working memory in `grimoires/loa/NOTES.md`:

### Memory Structure

```markdown
## Active Sub-Goals
<!-- Current objectives being pursued -->

## Discovered Technical Debt
<!-- Issues found during implementation that need future attention -->

## Blockers & Dependencies
<!-- External factors affecting progress -->

## Session Continuity
<!-- Key context to restore on next session -->
| Timestamp | Agent | Summary |

## Decision Log
<!-- Major decisions with rationale -->
```

### Agent Protocol

1. **Session Start**: Read NOTES.md to restore context
2. **During Execution**: Log significant decisions with rationale
3. **Before Compaction/End**: Summarize session insights
4. **Tool Result Clearing**: Apply semantic memory decay after heavy operations

See `.claude/protocols/structured-memory.md` for detailed protocol.

---

## Trajectory Evaluation (ADK-Level)

Agents log reasoning to `grimoires/loa/a2a/trajectory/{agent}-{date}.jsonl`:

### Log Format

```json
{"timestamp": "...", "agent": "...", "action": "...", "reasoning": "...", "grounding": {...}}
```

### Grounding Types

- `citation`: Direct quote from docs
- `code_reference`: Reference to existing code
- `assumption`: Ungrounded claim (must flag)
- `user_input`: Based on user request

### Evaluation-Driven Development (EDD)

- **Minimum 3 test scenarios** before marking a task complete
- **Factual grounding**: All claims must cite sources or be flagged as `[ASSUMPTION]`
- **Trajectory audit**: Reasoning logs are auditable for hallucination detection

See `.claude/protocols/trajectory-evaluation.md` for detailed protocol.

---

## Best Practices

### For All Phases

1. **Answer Thoroughly**: Agents ask questions for a reason
2. **Clarify Early**: If unclear, ask agents to rephrase
3. **Review Outputs**: Always review generated documents
4. **Iterate Freely**: Use the feedback loop for improvement

### For Implementation

- **Provide Clear Feedback**: Be specific in feedback files
- **Use File References**: Include file paths and line numbers
- **Explain Why**: Don't just say "fix this"—explain reasoning
- **Test Before Approving**: Run verification steps from report

### For DevOps & Infrastructure

- Security first—never compromise on fundamentals
- Automate everything that can be automated
- Design for failure—everything will eventually fail
- Monitor before deploying—can't fix what you can't see
- Document runbooks and incident response procedures

## Tips for Success

1. **Trust the Process**: Each phase builds on the previous—don't skip steps
2. **Be Patient**: Thorough discovery prevents costly mistakes later
3. **Engage Actively**: Agents need your input for good decisions
4. **Review Everything**: You're the final decision-maker
5. **Use Feedback Loop**: The implementation cycle is your quality gate
6. **Security First**: Especially for crypto/blockchain—never compromise

---

**Remember**: This process is designed to be thorough and iterative. Quality takes time, and each phase ensures you're building the right thing, the right way. Embrace the process, engage with the agents, and leverage their expertise to build exceptional products.
