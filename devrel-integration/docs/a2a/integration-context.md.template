## Cross-Agent Integration Patterns

### Information Flow
```
[Describe how information flows between organizational tools and agents]

Example:
Discord Discussion
    ↓ (captured context)
Linear Issue (PRD source)
    ↓ (requirements extraction)
docs/prd.md
    ↓ (design phase)
docs/sdd.md
    ↓ (planning phase)
docs/sprint.md + Linear Tasks
    ↓ (implementation phase)
Code + Updated Linear Issues
    ↓ (deployment phase)
Production + Updated Documentation
```

## Important Constraints

### What NOT to Automate
[List things agents should NOT do automatically - require human approval]

Example for Hivemind:
- ❌ Auto-assign issues without CX Lead review
- ❌ Force template fields to be filled
- ❌ Auto-move items between teams
- ❌ Generate LEARNINGS without human validation
- ❌ Change existing workflows without team discussion

### Agent Philosophy
✅ **Assist, suggest, pre-populate, remind** — but always let humans make final decisions
✅ **Maintain context chains** for async work
✅ **Link back to sources** for traceability
✅ **Document decision rationale** for future team members

## Notes for All Agents

- **Always check if this file exists** before starting your work
- **If this file is present**, incorporate the integration context into your workflow
- **If this file is absent**, proceed with standard agentic-base workflow (docs-only)
- **Respect the constraints** - integration should enhance, not override, human decision-making
- **Maintain async-first mindset** - your outputs should enable anyone to pick up where things left off
