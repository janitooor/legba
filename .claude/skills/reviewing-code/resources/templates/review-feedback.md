## Adversarial Analysis

{REQUIRED: Complete this section even if approving}

### Concerns Identified (minimum 3)

1. **{Concern category}** - `{file}:{line}`
   {Description of concern and potential impact}

2. **{Concern category}** - `{file}:{line}`
   {Description of concern and potential impact}

3. **{Concern category}** - `{file}:{line}`
   {Description of concern and potential impact}

{If fewer than 3 concerns found, explain why implementation is exceptionally solid}

### Assumptions Challenged (minimum 1)

- **Assumption**: {What the engineer assumed without explicit validation}
- **Risk if wrong**: {What breaks if this assumption fails}
- **Recommendation**: {Make explicit in code/docs OR validate with test OR accept risk because X}

### Alternatives Not Considered (minimum 1)

- **Alternative**: {Different approach that could have been taken}
- **Tradeoff**: {Pros/cons vs current approach}
- **Verdict**: {Current approach justified because X OR should reconsider}

### Adversarial Verdict

{BLOCKING / NON-BLOCKING / EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAN}

{If NON-BLOCKING: Concerns are documented but don't prevent approval}
{If BLOCKING: Must address concerns before approval}
{If EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAN: Explain why no concerns exist - this is rare}

## Next Steps

1. Address all critical issues above
2. Run tests and verify fixes
3. Update the report in `grimoires/loa/a2a/sprint-{N}/reviewer.md`
4. Request another review via `/review-sprint sprint-{N}`
