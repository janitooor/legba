# Naming conventions for Loa commands to avoid conflicts
naming_guidelines:
  description: "Guidelines for naming Loa commands to prevent future conflicts"
  rules:
    - "Use descriptive, domain-specific names (e.g., /sprint-plan, /architect)"
    - "For generic functionality, add -loa suffix (e.g., /config-loa, /mcp-config)"
    - "Prefer multi-word commands with hyphens over single words"
    - "Never use single-character commands (reserved for Claude Code)"
    - "Check this registry before adding new commands"

# Conflict resolution
conflict_resolution:
  strategy: "auto-rename"
  suffix: "-loa"
  examples:
    - conflict: "config"
      resolution: "mcp-config"
      reason: "More specific name better describes functionality"
    - conflict: "review"
      resolution: "review-sprint"
      reason: "Loa already uses review-sprint (no conflict)"

# Maintenance
maintenance:
  check_frequency: "On every /setup and /update"
  validation_script: ".claude/scripts/validate-commands.sh"
  update_process: "Monitor Claude Code release notes for new built-in commands"
